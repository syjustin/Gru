        <h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>
        <o> gusto ko magmessage sa end of the day kasi save the best for last nga daw jk anw before the day ends I just wanted to thank you for everything despite na hindi pa tayo nagkikita in person HAHHAHAHA. Thank you so much for always being there for me, sa pagsama sa akin especially every midnight sa pagreview, paglaro, discord moments and more napupuyat tuloy kita hays, but I really appreciated your company a lot and it comforts me everytime im with you. I love the way you express yourself, it shows who you really are and thats what i like about you for being pure and genuine. I love how you are sensitive and very careful with almost everything HAHAHAHA you always check up on me and make sure if iâ€™m okay. 

I love staying at my comfort zone, but you are the risk im willing to take. I hope to see you soon and looking forward to it and to our future endeavors. Thank you and I hope you had a great day! Once again, happy birthday my gru hehehe mwaa !! </p>
